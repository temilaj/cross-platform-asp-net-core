# Cross platform ASP.NET core
Code sample detailing how to create ASP.NET core applications on any OS

## Run & Deploy

restore the application dependencies described in the `cross-platform-asp-net-core.csproj` file

```bash
dotnet restore
```

run the application

```bash
dotnet run
```

The `dotnet restore` command first restores the necessary packages required to run the application, 
the `dotnet run` command simultaneously re-compiles and runs the application in the terminal
